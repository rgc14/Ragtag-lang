my own personal notes

int, flt, str, if-else, loops, arrays (or whatever version of arrays I use), write (files and console), read (files and console), pow, sqrt, cbrt are to be in the main module, create a template for arrays

focus on int, flt, read, write now

for printing will have 2 "modes", console and files

write mode 1
write a

prints value of a to console

output-file "out.txt"
write mode 2 "w"
write a

prints value of a to "out.txt" in write mode, use "a" for append

default is mode 1

if not initilized int will be set to 0, flt to 0.0 and str to "", no error message will be provided

no order of operations, goes straight right to left, no parenthesis/brackets

vars cannot start with number
